# Load and Booking Management System

This is a backend system developed using Spring Boot and PostgreSQL to manage load and booking operations, as part of the SDE Internship assignment for CargoPro.

## Objective

To develop a robust, scalable, and secure backend system with a full suite of REST APIs for managing loads and their corresponding bookings.

## Technologies Used

* **Framework:** Spring Boot 3.3.0
* **Language:** Java 17
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Data Access:** Spring Data JPA / Hibernate
* **API Documentation:** Swagger / OpenAPI (via springdoc-openapi)
* **Testing:** JUnit 5, Mockito

## Features Implemented

* **Full CRUD APIs** for both Load and Booking entities.
* **Advanced Filtering & Pagination** for retrieving loads (`GET /load`).
* **Advanced Filtering** for retrieving bookings (`GET /booking`).
* **Business Logic & Status Transitions** as per the assignment rules.
* **Global Exception Handling** for clean, user-friendly error responses.
* **Interactive API Documentation** via Swagger UI.
* **Unit Test Coverage** for the service layer.

## API Documentation

The complete, interactive API documentation is generated by Swagger and can be accessed while the application is running at the following URL:

[**http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html**](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)

## Setup and Run Instructions

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Java 17 or later
    * Maven
    * PostgreSQL

2.  **Database Setup:**
    * Open PostgreSQL and create a new database (e.g., `cargopro_db`).
    * The application will not create tables for you. You must run the SQL scripts found in `src/main/resources/schema.sql` to create the `loads` and `bookings` tables. (Note: You will need to create this `schema.sql` file and put the `CREATE TABLE` commands in it).

3.  **Configuration:**
    * Open the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file.
    * Update the `spring.datasource.password` property with your PostgreSQL password.

4.  **Running the Application:**
    * You can run the application directly from your IDE by running the `main` method in the `LinternshipProjectApplication.java` file.
    * Alternatively, you can build the project using Maven and run the JAR file:
        ```bash
        mvn clean install
        java -jar target/Iinternship_project-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
        ```

## Assumptions Made

* **Booking Deletion Logic:** The assignment had conflicting rules for booking deletion. I have implemented the rule: "If all bookings for a load are deleted or rejected, revert the Load's status to POSTED." This seems more logical for a real-world scenario.
* **Load Update:** The `PUT /load/{loadId}` endpoint does not allow updating the `shipperId` or `status` directly, as these are typically controlled by system logic rather than direct user updates.
